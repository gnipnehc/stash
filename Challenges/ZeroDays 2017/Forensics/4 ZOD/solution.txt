Use pdfdetach on zod.pdf to recursively extract embedded attachments

The file zod.pdf has an attachment called 1000.pdf
The file 1000.pdf has an attachment called 999.pdf
...you get the point
So now just write a script to automate this until flag.pdf
PS: be nice to your HDD/SSD by deleting previous attachments as you go along

#!/usr/bin/python
import os
for i in range(1,1000)[::-1]:
    os.system("./pdfdetach -saveall %d.pdf" % i)
    os.remove("%d.pdf" % i)
