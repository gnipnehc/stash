I formatted the given code as a nasm file and removed the horrid AT&T syntax. Then I tried to compile it and failed miserably. So here's the equivalent in Python:

ebx = 19
ecx = 31218
ebx -= ecx
eax = 19211
ebx += eax
print(ebx - eax) # -31199
ebx *= eax
ebx -= eax
eax = ebx
eax += ecx
print(eax) # -230289461

The answer is -230289461 although I have my doubts.
