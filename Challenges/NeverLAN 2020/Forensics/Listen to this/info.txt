After fiddling around with the spectrogram view in Audacity for a long while, it becomes apparent that the left channel has no morse code, while the right one does.

Searching online reveals a tool that can help extract the differences between them.

$ sox HiddenAudio.mp3 leftchannel.wav remix 1
$ sox HiddenAudio.mp3 rightchannel.wav remix 2
$ sox -m -v 1 leftchannel.wav -v -1 rightchannel.wav sound-difference.wav

A special thanks to:

 • https://sound.stackexchange.com/a/40226

Viewing the result in Audacity again shows a much clearer view of the morse code.
